        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Noah Hoff — a fullstack .NET developer student passionate about technology, problem-solving,
          and continuous learning. I worked for many years in the Foodmarket industry, which I loved, but felt it was time for a change.
        </p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          Cooking is one of my main hobbies. Experimenting in the kitchen sparks creativity and always leads to
          delicious results.

        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>
          I love solving problems and learning new things. This means that I enjoy everything from games, puzzles and math to gardening or carpentry.
        </p>
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>
          I used to be a rock climber, which I loved, but moved a little too far away from the place I trained at. To keep myself active without climbing I go to the gym 3 times a week, and try to get outside once a day.
        </p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>
          Last year, a friend and I began watching movies together, discussing, and rating each film.
          Inspired by this hobby I decided to develop a movie-rating website that offers a broader score
          range (0-100) and a more intuitive way to sort movies. I'm currently working on this side project.
        </p>
        <h3>Personal & Relationships</h3>
        <p>
          I live in Trångsund with my girlfriend of 5 years, and our crazy cat Luna.
